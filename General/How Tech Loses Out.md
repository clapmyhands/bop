if you outsource 90% of what your company does, the fate of the company does not lie in your hands.
if you separate the designing from the producing, then you lose out on innovation.
smart engineer wants to get their hands dirty and improve but outsourcing to reduce risk also removes their job scope.
as an engineer, try to fight to claim the important parts. the one that decides the company's fate. like the microchip in toaster.
dont try to claim over every little thing that might not matter, like a fuse in a toaster.
